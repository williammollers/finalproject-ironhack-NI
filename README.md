# Northern ireland (NI): Brexit, Religion & Reunification  
This project is a part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp Oct 2020 - Jan 2021 at IRON HACK, Berlin, Germany .

I completed this project in 11 days during the bootcamp and was designed to test the knowledge I had gained during the bootcamp. 

This was my first ever larger and independently constructed individual project. I alone decided the entire scope of the project and it therefore is not perfect :).

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project was to analyse RELIGION / VOTING data in Northern Ireland (NI) to see whether these two statements could be clarified:
* Identify electorates in NI that future YES (in a reunification campaign) campaigners should target
* Determine whether there is correlation between religious identity and voting patterns

##### Methods Used

* Kanban (in Trello)
* Data Acquisition (i.e. webscraping)
* Data Exploration / Cleaning / Wrangling 
* Correlation Analysis 
* Data Visualization 
* Presentation 

##### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Pandas
* Webscraping
* Numpy
* Excel 
* Tableau
* Powerpoint

## Project Description
The data used in this project was provided by the IRONHACK team and in general it was a fairly clean dataset.

In the beginning I was tasked with exploring the data in MySql and then to carry out further EDA, cleaning and wrangling within my Jupyter Notebook using python and it's associated libraries. Visualisation was completed in Tableau.

There were many challenges in the project, including the following:

First time doing something like this. Therefore I spent a lot of time on structure and hope that the project is easy to read.
Tableau was something that we had barely touched before this. Therefore were some visualisations far from ideal, but I am sure this will improve by the next commit.
The project occurred during the 3rd week of Germany's second lockdown. This made exchanging opinion with colleagues very difficult and it was truly an individal project.
Needs of this project
data exploration/descriptive statistics
data processing/cleaning
statistical modeling

Getting Started
Clone this repo (for help see this tutorial).
Raw Data is being kept [here]https://github.com/williammollers/housing-regression-ironhack-midtermproject-nov-2020/tree/master/PYTHON_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS) within this repo.
Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept here
Featured Notebooks/Analysis/Deliverables
All in all we had to deliver a MySql query book, a jupyter notebook, a Tableau dashboard, this readme file and a presentation (to be added)
